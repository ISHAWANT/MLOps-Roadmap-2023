What is MLOps?
MLOps is a term that combines machine learning (ML) and operations (Ops). It refers to the set of practices and processes that aim to streamline and optimize the development, deployment, and maintenance of machine learning models in production environments.

MLOps is inspired by DevOps, a software engineering culture that emphasizes collaboration, communication, automation, and continuous improvement across the software development lifecycle. DevOps aims to deliver software products faster, more reliably, and more securely.

However, machine learning systems pose unique challenges that require additional considerations and solutions. For example:

•  Machine learning systems depend on data quality, availability, and diversity, which can change over time and affect model performance.

•  Machine learning systems involve complex workflows that span multiple stages, such as data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, validation, testing, deployment, monitoring, and retraining.

•  Machine learning systems require specialized skills and tools that are often not compatible or integrated with existing software engineering practices and platforms.

MLOps addresses these challenges by applying DevOps principles and techniques to machine learning systems. Some of the key aspects of MLOps are:

•  Data management: ensuring data quality, security, accessibility, and governance throughout the machine learning lifecycle.

•  Model management: tracking model versions, metadata, artifacts, dependencies, and performance metrics across different environments.

•  Workflow orchestration: automating and coordinating the execution of machine learning pipelines across different stages and platforms.

•  Testing and validation: ensuring model correctness, robustness, fairness, explainability, and compliance with business requirements and ethical standards.

•  Deployment and serving: delivering machine learning models to end-users or applications in a scalable, reliable, and secure manner.

•  Monitoring and observability: collecting and analyzing data on model performance, behavior, usage, and health in production environments.

•  Continuous improvement: updating and retraining machine learning models based on feedback loops from monitoring data or changing business needs.

Why MLOps?
MLOps can provide many benefits for organizations that adopt machine learning technologies and seek to deploy and manage their models in a production environment effectively. Some of the benefits are:

•  Faster time-to-market: MLOps can reduce the gap between model development and deployment by automating and streamlining the machine learning lifecycle.

•  Higher quality: MLOps can improve model accuracy, reliability, robustness, and explainability by applying rigorous testing and validation methods.
•  Lower cost: MLOps can reduce the operational and maintenance costs of machine learning systems by optimizing resource utilization and preventing model degradation or failure.

•  Better collaboration: MLOps can foster collaboration and communication among different stakeholders, such as data scientists, data engineers, software engineers, business analysts, and product managers, by establishing common standards and platforms.

•  Higher innovation: MLOps can enable faster experimentation and iteration of machine learning models by providing feedback loops and reusable components.
